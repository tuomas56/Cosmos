    Cosmos supports running on any Intel x86 environment. However for debugging and 
    ease of use, many virtual and physical setups have integrated support. If you do 
    not see your environment, this does not mean Cosmos will not work. You can 
    simply fall back to ISO which should work with any environment.<h3>
        ISO</h3>
    <p>
        The ISO option creates an ISO image of the Cosmos output. This ISO file can be 
        mounted and booted by most virtualization technologies. In addition a physical 
        optical disk can be burned and used to boot physical hardware.</p>
    <h3>
        VMWare Workstation</h3>
    <p>
        WMWare Workstation and VMWare Player are the preferred testing environments for 
        Cosmos. This is because they are stable, reliable, and easily controlled by the 
        Cosmos Visual Studio integration package. This second point provides for a 
        seemless development and debugging process.</p>
    <p>
        VMWare Workstation is not free, however VMWare Player is. VMWare Player for the 
        typical Cosmos developer provides more than enough functionality.</p>
